### WHAT IS THIS?

Tab Chaos Mode™ is a browser extension designed to **ruin your productivity** in the most delightfully confusing way possible.

Every time you open a new tab, there’s a **10% chance** that instead of your boring old blank page, you get slammed with a random Wikipedia page about:

- Obscure 1800s diseases (yep, typhoid fever, anyone?)  
- Failed 90s tech disasters (remember Betamax?)  
- Conspiracy theories that *might* explain why your socks disappear  
- Bizarre historical events that make you go “What the heck?”  
- Weird animal facts that will haunt your dreams  
- Obscure internet memes no one remembers (or pretends not to)

- **Toggle Button**: Turn chaos mode on or off with a single click  
- **Chaos History**: Keep track of all the wild tabs that have blessed your screen this session
